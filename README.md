# UFOs

## Overview of Project

Using data compiled of possible UFO sightings, I created an HTML page that lets users filter through the data based on their own search criteria.

## Results

When first opened, the index.html file shows the entire table populated. The page allows for you to filter between five different criterias; Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. The user can filter the data between one, some, or all of the filters provided. The filters can be erased, showing the data in its entirety once more.

## Summary

One drawback I immediately noticed is that the user has to manually clear each filter and refresh to start filtering from scratch again. A "clear filters" option would be handy to make this process a lot faster. Another drawback is that the user is unable to save their filtered data, and would have to return to the page and reenter their information to find the data again. Having the option to export their filtered data to a CSV file would make this page a lot more user friendly.
